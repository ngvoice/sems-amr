pinauthconference example application
-------------------------------------

This application example does collect the PIN=conference
room number via DTMF, plays the room number and then
connects the caller to the conference room. 

It uses AmPromptCollection to load a set of needed prompts:
 "entering_conference"
 "first_participant"
 "join_sound"
 "drop_sound"
 "enter_pin"
 "wrong_pin"

and 0.wav, 1.wav, 2.wav, ... 9.wav in digits_dir.

These need to be set in the configuration.
