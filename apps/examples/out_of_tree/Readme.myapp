This is an empty template for a SEMS application plug-in written in C++.

It can reside out of the SEMS source tree and just needs the libsems1-dev
package installed to be compiled. For this to work, in the Makefile the
following needs to be defined:
 plug_in_name = myapp
 COREPATH ?=/usr/include/sems
 DEFSPATH ?=/usr/include/sems
 app_module_dir=.
 include $(COREPATH)/plug-in/Makefile.app_module
