cc_acc

This module implements the accounting functions for the calling
card example, specifically the cc_acc interface. 

It maintains a local in memory map of credits. These can for example
be set using the xmlrpc2di module from XMLRPC, or any other module 
by invoking the DI functions setCredit, getCredit, addCredit,
subtractCredit.

See the cc_acc_xmlrpc module and its Readme for another implementation
of the cc_acc interface.
