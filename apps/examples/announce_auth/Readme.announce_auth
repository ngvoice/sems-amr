announce_auth

This is a sample application demonstrating how to place calls
as UAC with authentication. realm, username and password as well as 
number to dial from/to is configured in config file (see 
etc/announce_auth.conf)

After 5 seconds it calls a number and plays an announcement to it.
It does that again every 10 minutes.
