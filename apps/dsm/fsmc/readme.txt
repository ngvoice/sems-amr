Note: This is just rather a proof of concept. Improvements are welcome.

You will need qt3 (not 4) to compile fsme/fsmc. As of july 08, 
the current version is 1.0.4.

DSM Conditions are "Events" in fsme. To make a new state, click on the
empty leaf in the treeview on the left side. Sub-leafs are transitions, 
open the tree and click on one to make a new transition.

It would actually be nice to print the condition name as comment, and 
use the event body as condition (the same for actions).
