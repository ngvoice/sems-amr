webconference PyQT GUI

This example demonstrates how simple it is to write a UI for webconference.
It was intended as webconf UI for Nokia Internet Tablets, but it turns out
that XMLRPC over https every second is too much for that device (=drains a
lot of power).

Requires: PyQT4, QT4

To set an account permanently (and not be asked all the time) do 
 mv accountconfig.py.sample accountconfig.py 
and edit the account in it.

To use your own conference bridge, edit CONTROL_URL in webconference.py and
on your sems server set direct_export=webconference in xmlrpc2di.conf.

All improvements are welcome, preferably as patch to semsdev list 
(mailto:semsdev@iptel.org).
